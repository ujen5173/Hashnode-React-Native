# Hashnode Clone using React Native
A full-stack application clone of Hashnode built with a modern tech stack, utilizing React Native, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, and MongoDB. This project aims to replicate the functionality and design of Hashnode while incorporating various technologies for a seamless experience.

# [[WEB] Previous Projects using Next.js.](https://github.com/ujen5173/hashnode)
I've also built a similar clone using Next.js, Tailwind, and Drizzle-ORM with PostgreSQL. Check out the project on my GitHub or [here](https://github.com/ujen5173/hashnode). Additionally, another version was created using Prisma ORM (refer to the README file for more details).
